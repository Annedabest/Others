# Infrastructure Setup

This directory will track infrastructure configuration for storage, queues, and supporting services.

## Initial Tasks
- Define object storage provisioning scripts (e.g., Terraform/Azure/AWS).
- Configure message queue resources for receipt ingestion pipelines (Redis/Temporal).
- Document environment variables and secrets management approach.

Add provider-specific modules here as the implementation progresses.
